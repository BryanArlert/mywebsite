            <p>Hey Amy! Wow, it’s been three weeks since I last wrote—sorry about that. I know I told you that I'll update you daily, But its just been crazy busy, I mean whew. Anyway, it’s been crazy around here. Moving back into this old place has me running around like crazy—fixing stuff, cleaning more, just trying to get it all sorted. I didn’t mean to leave you hanging like that. Hope you’re not mad at me!</p>
            <p>Honestly, though, it’s not so bad out here. Once you get past the dust and the creaky floors, it’s kind of growing on me. I’ve been busy every day—patching up holes in the walls, messing with the plumbing, even got the old stove working again. Keeps my mind off things, you know? Thought you’d like hearing that I’m not just moping around like I used to in the city.</p>
            <p>Okay, so something weird happened the other day, and I’ve got to tell you about it. I was down in the basement, fixing some loose wiring—nothing big, just trying to get the lights to stop flickering. Out of nowhere, I heard my mom’s voice, clear as day, saying, “Bruce, come eat dinner.” I froze. Amy, there’s no way that was real—she’s been gone for years, you know that. I checked the whole house after, but it was just me. Probably just tired, right? Anyway, let me know what you think—still doing this for you!</p>
