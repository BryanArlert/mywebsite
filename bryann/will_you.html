            <h2>A Perfect Morning</h2>
            <p>Hello everyone! I’m Bruce! Why is this website called Zeback? Well, it’s my nickname from high school. I think some introduction is needed. I’m 25 years old and I worked at a company with cubicles. But now I moved back to my old parents’ house in the countryside, just trying to live a quiet life. As you might have seen on the homepage, I did this because of a friend that I have and I might have a crush on her. Don’t tell her though. But really, I just want to record my day-to-day life here. I’m starting new, and I want to record this moment—well, not me, but somebody really wanted to see my day-to-day life (I’m talking about you, Amy), and so here we are.</p>

            <p>Well, I moved out of this house a while back. When I moved out, some bad stuff happened, but I can’t really tell you what it is. Not yet. Anyway, hopefully you enjoy my blogs, Amy, and stay tuned for when I post more!</p>
