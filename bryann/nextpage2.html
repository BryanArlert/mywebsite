            <h2>A Quieter Day</h2>
            <p>Hey everyone. It’s been a few days since my last post—sorry about that. Today’s been kind of slow. Stayed in mostly, just thinking about things. The weather’s still nice, but I didn’t feel like going out much. Sometimes you just need a day to sit with your thoughts, you know?</p>

            <h2>Remembering Dad</h2>
            <p>I’ve been thinking about my dad a lot lately. He wasn’t around much growing up, and when I was 19, everything fell apart. I was in my second year of college, juggling exams and a part-time job, when I got the call. He’d shot himself. Took my mom with him too. It’s hard to write that even now. I don’t talk about it much, but it’s been on my mind today. Anyone else carry stuff like that around?</p>

            <h2>Pieces of the Story</h2>
            <p>They found them in the house I grew up in. I hadn’t been back there in months—college kept me busy, and honestly, I didn’t want to deal with Dad’s moods. He’d been drinking more, fighting with Mom. I didn’t know how bad it’d gotten. The police said it was quick, at least. I remember sitting in my dorm after, just staring at the wall, wondering why I didn’t see it coming. Still don’t have answers.</p>

            <h2>Trying to Move On</h2>
            <p>It’s been years now, but days like today bring it all back. I dropped out of college for a while after it happened—couldn’t focus. Eventually went back, finished my degree. Built a life. But there’s this weight that never quite lifts. I’ll try to write something lighter tomorrow. Thanks for reading this, whoever you are.</p>
