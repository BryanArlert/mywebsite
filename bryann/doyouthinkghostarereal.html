            <h1>Do You Think Ghosts Are Real?</h1>
            <p class="date">April 12, 2009</p>
            <p>Amy, whoever’s reading this—I don’t know what’s happening anymore. It’s been two days since I last wrote, but it feels longer. The noises haven’t stopped, and now there are dreams. Every night, I see them: faceless people hanging from the trees outside, cutting their wrists in the bathroom, blood pooling on the floor. I hear my mother screaming for help, her voice tearing through the dark, begging me to save her. And Dad—he’s there too, standing in the basement, staring at me. Then he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. I wake up soaked in sweat, the sound of the shot still ringing in my ears.</p>
            <p>It’s not just the dreams. During the day, I keep seeing things—shadows darting in the corner of my eye. A figure by the window that’s gone when I turn. Something moving in the hallway, but when I look, it’s empty. The knocks are louder now, like someone’s pounding to get in, and the voices—Mom and Dad—they’re not just calling me anymore. They’re whispering things I can’t make out, right behind me when I’m alone. I checked the basement again yesterday. Nothing’s there, but the tools were scattered, like someone had been using them.</p>
            <p>I can’t explain this, Amy. I can’t explain it to you, whoever you are reading this. I’m not sleeping right, I’m not thinking straight. My uncle’s warning keeps replaying in my head—“Don’t go back there”—and now I’m wondering if he knew something. Do you think ghosts are real? I never did, but now… what else could this be? Tell me I’m not crazy. Tell me you’ve got an answer, because I’m starting to feel like this house isn’t mine anymore. It’s theirs.</p>
