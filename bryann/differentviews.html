            <p>Hey Amy! So, it’s been a week since I moved back into my old parents’ house—you know, that thing you told me to write about? Figured I’d give you a peek into what’s been going on since I left the city. It’s weird being back here after college. The place was a total wreck when I got in—dust piled up, cobwebs everywhere, that stale smell like it’s been holding its breath since I left. Been cleaning nonstop just to make it livable again.</p>
            <p>You’d laugh at how different it is out here compared to the city. No more sirens waking me up or people yelling outside my window. It’s just… quiet. Fields stretch out instead of buildings, and at night, I can actually see stars—not just those flickering streetlights we’d walk under. It’s throwing me off a bit, honestly. Thought you’d like hearing about that since you’re always saying I need to chill out more.</p>
            <p>Been keeping busy, though—scrubbing floors, fixing a faucet that wouldn’t stop dripping, mowing the yard that looked like a jungle. Found some old stuff in the attic too—pictures of me as a kid, Dad’s rusty tools, Mom’s handwriting in some recipe books. Made me think about them more than I expected. Anyway, it’s not all bad being out here. Maybe you’d like it too? Let me know what you think—I’m doing this for you, after all!</p>
