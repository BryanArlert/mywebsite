            <h1>I Keep Hearing Them</h1>
            <p class="date">April 10, 2009</p>
            <p>Hey Amy, it’s been a week since I last wrote. Things have been… off. I was going to tell you how nice it’s been settling in, but I can’t shake this weird stuff that’s happening. I keep hearing noises—like, all the time now. Knocks on the windows when I’m trying to sleep, bangs on the front door when I’m in the kitchen. I check every time, but there’s nothing. No one. Just the wind, maybe? I don’t know.</p>
            <p>It’s not just that, though. I’ve been hearing voices—Mom and Dad’s voices. Like last time in the basement, but now it’s more. Yesterday, I swear I heard Mom laugh from upstairs while I was making coffee. And Dad—his voice keeps calling me from the basement, telling me to come down. That’s where he used to work on his projects, you remember me telling you? I haven’t gone down there since last week, but I hear him tinkering—tools clanging, like he’s still there. They’re gone, Amy. They’ve been gone for years.</p>
            <p>I’m starting to think I’m losing it. The house is fixed up now, so it’s not like I’m overworked or anything. Maybe it’s the quiet out here messing with my head—I’m not used to it after the city. But it’s every night now, these sounds. Knocks, voices, that basement noise. I keep telling myself it’s nothing, but it’s getting harder to brush off. I know its probably nothing, but im starting to get scared.</p>
