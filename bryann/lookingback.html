            <h1>Looking Back</h1>
            <p class="date">April 3, 2009</p>
            <p>Hey Amy! Finally got a breather today—most of the big stuff around the house is done. Fixed the last leaky pipe, patched up the walls, even got the porch swing working again. Now I’m just kicking back with a beer, sitting out here watching the sunset over the fields. It’s peaceful, you know? Gives me some time to think about things, and I figured I’d write it down for you.</p>
            <p>Being back here makes me remember all sorts of stuff. Like when I was a kid, my mom would make these delicious food. I would play in the field with the cows, do all sort of stuff with Junior, my dead dog bless his soul, or just looking at my dad while he's working you know? Its peaceful here.</p>
            <p>Here's something i havent told you yet, dont really know if i should, but meh. You met my uncle right, ben? Well anyway, before i came here, he told me to not do it. I think his exact words are "I forbid you to go there, bruce." and i replied with "Why?" and all my uncle said was "Dont." It felt weird, you know? seeing my uncle like that. Almost like he was pleading with me. But its my parents, why wouldnt i want to be here?</p>
